2.	In 2023, the South region led in sales, with West showing the least sales while the 2024 sales showed  South continued to lead, followed by East, with West again showing the lowest sales
3.	In 2023, shirts had the highest sales among products, while hats struggled to gain traction. By 2024, we observed dips in jacket and sock sales, while hats and shoes saw an increase.
4.	Comparing 2023 and 2024 quarterly trends, Q1 sales were higher in 2024, though both years experienced significant drops in Q2—more severe in 2023. While 2023 saw a rebound in Q3, 2024 continued to decline

Seasonal demand cycles are also evident, with Q1 and Q3 favoring socks, shoes, and shirts, and Q2 and Q4 favoring hats, gloves, and jackets. !

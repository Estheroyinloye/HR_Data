```
- Pivot tables
- Filters
- Slicers

### Data Source
The data was obtained from an open-source data site as a CSV file, after which it was cleaned, analysed, and visualized with Microsoft Excel.

### Data Transformation and cleaning
To clean the data, duplicates and blanks were removed from from the table using the " Remove duplicate" and "filter" button in excel.
Trim funtion was used to remove excess spaces

4.	Laboratory Technicians and Sales Executives showed the highest attrition counts,with a noticeable proportion of both males and females leaving these roles while the Research Directors and Managers experience the lowest attrition rates, indicating potentially higher job satisfaction or stability within these roles.
5.	Attrition is highest among employees with a Life Sciences or Medical background, while Field like the Human Resources had e very low attrition rates.
6.	The R&D department showed the highest attrition rate 56.1%, followed by Sales and HR having a relatively low attrition rate 5.1%, suggesting greater stability or satisfaction within this department.

### Conclusion
The data revealed that employee attrition is significantly influenced by job role, satisfaction level, job level, department, gender, and age. 
Laboratory Technicians and Sales Executives exhibited the highest turnover, particularly among younger, entry-level employees with Life Sciences and Medical backgrounds. 
Employees with low job satisfaction were more likely to leave, highlighting satisfaction as a critical factor. 
The R&D and Sales departments experienced the highest attrition rates, with male employees showing a higher likelihood of departure compared to females. 

### Reccommendation
To reduce the attrition count, the organization could focus on enhancing job satisfaction in high-turnover departments like R&D and Sales and among entry-level employees. Additionally, the could implement targeted retention strategies for younger staff and provide clear career development paths, especially for roles with high turnover, such as Laboratory Technicians and Sales Executives.
